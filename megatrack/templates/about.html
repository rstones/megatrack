The MegaTrack Atlas is an online neuroimaging tool developed in the <a href="https://www.natbrainlab.co.uk/">Natbrainlab</a>
which is part of the <a href="https://sacklerinstitute.org/">Sackler Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk">King's College London</a>.
<br><br><br>
The tool provides access to white matter dissections of diffusion MRI data from the BRC Atlas dataset.
Users can query subjects based on certain demographics (age, gender etc) and view averaged density maps for different
 white matter tracts. Statistical metrics for the averaged tracts are also generated.
